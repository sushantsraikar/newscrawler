MUMBAI: In violation of Sebi's mutual fund norms, SPA Capital, a Delhi-based mutual fund distributor, had guaranteed a 9.5% yearly return to e-commerce major Flipkart on a Rs 250-crore investment by the online marketplace in three debt schemes of SBI Mutual Fund. According to the agreement between Flipkart and SPA Capital, a copy of which is with TOI, in case the investments didn't generate 9.5% return, SPA Capital was to make good the shortfall. In case of excess return, SPA Capital and Flipkart were to share the gains in excess of the guaranteed returns, equally. The date of investment was March 31, 2015. The two parties claim the agreement has been cancelled since it did not comply with Sebi norms. 
 Since the US64 fiasco in 2000, Sebi does not allow mutual funds to guarantee returns from any scheme. The regulator even does not allow MFs to name their scheme in a way that can give an impression of a guarantee of returns to investors. 
 When contacted, a spokesperson for SPA Capital said the agreement was a mistake on its part and once it was detected, it was cancelled through a mutual agreement. "The agreement entered into in March 2015 has already been mutually agreed to be null and void ab initio immediately thereafter due to compliance reasons," a spokesperson for SPA Capital said. 
 Flipkart denied any arrangement for guarantee of returns with the MF distributor while investing in these schemes. "We invest in mutual funds directly. SPA (Capital) is an adviser to us. There is no arrangement with them to guarantee us a particular yield," a Flipkart spokesperson said. On further probing, the firm said that the agreement was initiated but "was rendered null and void on account of compliance risks". 
 SBIMF, in whose schemes Flipkart had invested but was not a part to the agreement, said as a policy, the fund house "adheres to all regulatory guidelines in the interest of all stakeholders". 
 The agreement between Flipkart and SPA Capital also showed that Flipkart's investments in the three funds were under direct code, meaning SPA Capital did not get any commission for facilitating them. Industry sources said all of Flipkart's mutual fund investments are through the direct code, which also increases their total returns from such investments. The agreement also specified that in case Flipkart withdrew its investments within six months from the date of investing, it will not be able to claim the guarantee on returns.
